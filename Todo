                push( @$list, $obj );
        } else {
                my $rec = $args{'Shredder'}->GetRecord( Object => $self );
                $self = $rec->{'Object'};
                $rec->{'State'} |= INVALID;

	* investigate how to play with queue CFs, mainly when ticket was moved
	  to another queue, such tickets have CFs values, we should delete it
