See `perldoc lib/RTx/Shredder.pm' for more info about this distribution.

INSTALLATION

1) System rights

You should be logged in under user who has read rights on the RT config files and
write rights on the RT local dirs. This is limitation, but module must load
RT config files to proceed successfully.

2) Tarball or CPAN shell.

You can install from tarball or via CPAN shell, ofcouse if you install via
CPAN shell then most probably you havn't read this, but anyway I hope you'll
find this text when you hit problems. Installation from tarball as easy as
installation from CPAN shell except of dependencies. See below.

NOTE: CPAN shell doesn't install development releases unless you define exactly
version you want.

NOTE: Users of the CPAN shell, please, read this doc to the end because
if your RT is not in usual '/opt/rt3' location then you must know how
to set correct location.

3) Source

Get source from

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/RTx-Shredder

Brave guys could get sources from SVN

  https://opensvn.csie.org/rtx_shredder

4) Patch RT 3.4.0 and 3.4.1

RT doesn't allow searches on deleted tickets. I wrote patch that should be applied to RT.
Patch is shipped with distro under patches/ directory. You can apply it with next commands:

	cd /path/to/rt/dir
	cat /path/to/patch/file | patch -p0

NOTE: RT 3.4.2 and greater has this patch applied, you don't need to do anything.

5) Path to RT

Installer finds RT easy when your RT installation is in /opt/rt3, but
if you use own dirs layout (almost all distributions that has RT package
use own layouts) then you must define it.

You can use RTHOME environment variable to specify directory that
contains RT.pm or lib/RT.pm

6) `perl Makefile.PL`

If RT.pm couldn't be found you would be asked about path to RT.pm, see
above about RTHOME, you can use next command:

  `RTHOME=... perl Makefile.PL`

Check output, you should see something like this:
  Using RT configurations from /opt/rt3/lib/RT.pm:
  ./html  => /opt/rt3/share/html
  ./lib   => /opt/rt3/local/lib
  ./sbin  => /opt/rt3/local/sbin

If you see

  Warning: prerequisite <module> <version or zero> not found

Then you MUST install <module>, you really need this perl modules
to use and/or test shredder distribution.

7) `make`

8) `make test`

Please, don't skip this step, because you're going to install shredder and
when something wrong with tests you can lost real valuable data in production
database.

If something wrong with tests then report errors.
See `perldoc lib/RTx/Shredder.pm` for more info about reporting.

9) `make install`

10) `perldoc lib/RTx/Shredder.pm`
