I. INTRODUCTION

RTx-Shredder distribution has two parts.

1) RT API extension. It's group of files under lib dir.

2) Command line tools that allow you to do several tasks with your
RT instances. It's group of the files under bin and sbin dirs. Now
distro has next tools:
	rtx-shredder
	rtx-validator

Read PODs to know more about usage.

	perldoc rtx-shredder
	perldoc rtx-validator

II. INSTALL

1) System rights

You should be logged in under user who has read rights on the RT config files and
write rights on the RT local dirs. This is limitation, but module must load
RT config files to proceed successfully.

2) Environment and command line arguments

You can use PREFIX to specify RT prefix

	PREFIX=/opt/rt3 perl Makefile.PL
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt/rt3

Also you can use RTHOME env.
If RT.pm couldn't be found you would be asked about path to RT.pm.

NOTE: I didn't test with non standard locations of RT.
If you have problems please send me note about you layout and also
output of `perl Makefile.PL` command.

3) Patch(RT > 3.0.8 and RT < 3.4)

RT core API limit searches on deleted tickets. I wrote patch that should be applied to RT.
Patch is shipped with distro under patches/ directory. You can apply it with next commands:

	cd /path/to/rt/dir
	cat /path/to/patch/file | patch -p0

NOTE: patch generate rejections in Ticketss_Overlay_SQL.pm in RT-3.0.8 and previous versions.
You can ignore this. RT-3.0.8 have no code in Tickets_Overlay_SQL.pm that restrict search on
deleted tickets, but have code in other files that doesn't allow me to step through collection
of the deleted tickets.

NOTE: RT 3.4 has this patch in the mainline.

4) Testing

See `perldoc t/utils.pl` for more info about testing shredder distribution.

5) Installing

You have two variants to install files to appropriate locations

If you have make then you can use next commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


If you don't have make then you can install Module::Build perl module.
Then use next commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
