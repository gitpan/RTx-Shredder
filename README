See `perldoc lib/RTx/Shredder.pm' for more info about this distribution.

INSTALLATION

1) System rights

You should be logged in under user who has read rights on the RT config files and
write rights on the RT local dirs. This is limitation, but module must load
RT config files to proceed successfully.

2) Environment and command line arguments

You can use PREFIX to specify RT prefix

	PREFIX=/opt/rt3 perl Makefile.PL
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt/rt3

Also you can use RTHOME env.
If RT.pm couldn't be found you would be asked about path to RT.pm.

NOTE: I didn't test with non standard locations of RT.
If you have problems please send me note about you layout and also
output of `perl Makefile.PL` command.

3) Patch RT 3.4.0 and 3.4.1

RT core API limit searches on deleted tickets. I wrote patch that should be applied to RT.
Patch is shipped with distro under patches/ directory. You can apply it with next commands:

	cd /path/to/rt/dir
	cat /path/to/patch/file | patch -p0

NOTE: RT 3.4.2 and greater has this patch in the mainline.

4) Testing

See `perldoc t/utils.pl` for more info about testing shredder distribution.

5) Installing

You have two variants to install files to appropriate locations

If you have make then you can use next commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


If you don't have make then you can install Module::Build perl module.
Then use next commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
