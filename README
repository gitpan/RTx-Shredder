If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to write full README

Install process:

You should be user who has read right on RT config files and write rights on local dirs.
It's limitation, but module have to load configs.

Tests don't work at all.

1) Module::Build variant
perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build install

2) make variant
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

ENVIORMENT and ARGUMENTS

You can use PREFIX arg or env value to specify RT instance

PREFIX=/opt/rt3 perl Makefile.PL

apply it to your RT instance.
